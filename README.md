The ALgoalRITHM has the latest updated algo which I have used for selecting my Top 15 Squad.   
It primarily requires intricate data cleaning and knapsacking by the constraints.  
To write a blog regarding how my algorithm fared after I have 8 weeks of data.   
I have not included any of the new signings in my algo except same country switches like Willian from Chelsea to Arsenal.  
Primarily because in most cases it takes time for them to adapt to the new surroundings and team (the last exception was Bruno Fernandes 2019-20 season).  
GW(x) contain my points report of the Week "X" when the week finishes.  
Planning to introduce formations and transfer limit in the upcoming weeks.  
Also planning to introduce a tweet based recommendation system which carries 5-10 % of the overall selection criteria later.
